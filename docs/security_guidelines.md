# Security by Configuration

Implementing appropriate controls and settings to govern what can run and
when

* Define workkflow settings at Settings -> Actions -> General
* Restrict Action permissions: Last option allows org owned, github owned and explicitly allowed actions (would reccomend)
* Allow external collaborators to run workflows on PRs?
* Default workflow permissions: Only read
* Add CODEOWNERS file: Define groups or individuals reponsible for code files (Can automatically assign reviewers for PRs)
